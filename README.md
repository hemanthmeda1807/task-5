# Task 5 - Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

## Objective:
Capture live network traffic using Wireshark and identify at least three different protocols to understand how packet-based communication works in real time.

## Tools Used:
- Wireshark (free network protocol analyzer)

## Steps Performed:
1. Installed Wireshark on the system.
2. Started packet capture on the active network interface (eth0).
3. Generated network traffic by visiting Netflix website.

4. Captured traffic for around 1 minute and stopped the capture.
5. Applied protocol filters like `http`, `dns`, and `tcp` to inspect specific traffic types.
  - **http**

  - **DNS**

  - **tcp.port == 80||udp.port == 80**

  - **ip.addr == 10.0.2.15**

6. Saved the capture file in `.pcap` format.

7. Analyzed the packet details and documented findings:

## Protocols Identified:

### 1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- **Description**: Used for loading web pages over the internet.
- **Port**: 80
- **Packet Info**: GET requests and response headers observed.
- **Example**: Source IP: 10.0.2.15 â†’ Destination IP: 142.251.223.3

### 2. DNS (Domain Name System)
- **Description**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **Port**: 53
- **Packet Info**: Standard query and response for domains like `www.google.com`.

### 3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **Description**: Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
- **Port**: 443 (used for HTTPS)
- **Packet Info**: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK observed for connection handshakes.

## Sample Filters Used:
- `http`
- `dns`
- `tcp.port == 80||udp.port == 80`
- `ip.addr == 10.0.2.15`
